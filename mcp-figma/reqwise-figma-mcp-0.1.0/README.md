# Reqwise Figma MCP

**An MCP server that lets AI agents read and draw on the Figma canvas — safely.**

Reqwise Figma MCP pairs a local MCP server with a companion Figma plugin. Point Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-capable agent at it, and the agent can inspect a Figma file and draw into it by executing JavaScript against a `figma.*` proxy API — with the plugin layer catching the mistakes that usually turn "AI draws a screen" into "AI draws an overflowing, half-clipped mess."

It exists because the current generation of Figma MCPs make agents responsible for discipline they don't have: remembering never to overlay a semi-transparent frame, re-declaring token maps every call, manually computing x/y offsets, eyeballing screenshots to check for clipping. Reqwise moves that discipline into the server and plugin, and gives the agent a structured way to verify its own work.

## Why this one

| | Typical Figma MCP | Reqwise Figma MCP |
|---|---|---|
| Verification | Screenshot only — agent eyeballs pixels | `layout_audit` returns declared vs. rendered bounds, `overflowsParent`, `clippedBy`, `textTruncated` per node; screenshots stay for final human review |
| Overlays / scrims | Agent dims a screen with an opacity'd FRAME (dims the whole subtree) | `figma.overlay()` creates a correctly layered RECTANGLE — the mistake is structurally unavailable |
| Session state | Token maps and id registries re-declared every call | `state` is a persistent object per session; set up tokens once, reuse across calls |
| Connection | Silent boolean, or a dead WS with no explanation | `figma_status` returns diagnostics plus an ordered `hints` list of concrete next steps |
| Multiple IDE windows | Second server instance fights for the port or silently fails | Leader/follower election; followers forward through an authenticated `/rpc` to the one leader holding the plugin connection |
| Batch operations | Hard caps (e.g. 50 ops) with all-or-nothing failure | Chunked streaming, partial commit, exact per-index error reporting, no hard cap |
| Structural frames | Figma's default white fill turns layout wrappers into accidental white slabs | FRAME/COMPONENT without an explicit fill defaults to transparent; visible surfaces opt in |
| Sandbox JS | Restricted/older syntax (no `?.`, `??`, spread) | Node `vm` — full modern ES (optional chaining, nullish coalescing, spread, async/await) |
| Errors | Bare exceptions | Every failure carries `{code, message, hint}` — the hint is the next concrete step |
| Edit-in-place | Draw-from-scratch focus; per-op fights the single-threaded plugin | Selection-first workflow (`readSelection` → modify → `layout_audit`), instance-override "format painter", recursive recolor, mixed-font-safe text edits; writes serialized per connection so mutations never race |

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design rationale and the root-cause fixes behind these defaults.

## Quickstart

Unzip the package somewhere permanent (**not** inside a project). Open your AI in that folder **once**, and paste — naming your editor:

```
Read docs/SETUP.md, follow section 7, and set this up for me.
Register it globally so it works in all my projects.
I'm using: Claude Code
```

> - Name your tool (`Claude Code`, `Codex`, `Antigravity`, `Cursor`, `Claude Desktop`…). Each stores MCP servers in a different config file, and an AI **cannot** reliably detect which app it's running inside — a wrong guess writes a config your editor never reads.
> - Registered **globally**, the Figma tools then work in every project — you never open this folder again.

It builds, registers the server, verifies the connection, and hands you the two things it can't do: restarting your AI tool, and importing the plugin into Figma Desktop (GUI-only, ~15 seconds of clicking).

Full walkthrough, daily routine and troubleshooting: **[`docs/SETUP.md`](./docs/SETUP.md)**.

<details>
<summary>Or do it by hand</summary>

**1. Install**

Unzip the package, then inside that folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This builds the server to `dist/` and the plugin bundle to `plugin/code.js`. Both are build outputs — a fresh copy has neither, so don't skip this.

**2. Register the MCP server**

```bash
claude mcp add reqwise-figma -s user -- node /absolute/path/to/reqwise-figma-mcp/dist/server/index.js
```

(See [`docs/INSTALL.md`](./docs/INSTALL.md) for Cursor and Claude Desktop JSON config, plus `npx`-based setups.)

**3. Import the plugin into Figma Desktop**

Figma Desktop → menu → **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest…** → select `plugin/manifest.json` from this folder. Run it from **Plugins → Development → Reqwise Figma MCP** and keep its window open.

**4. Check the connection**

Ask your agent to call `figma_status`. A healthy connection looks like:

```json
{
  "pluginConnected": true,
  "mode": "leader",
  "port": 38470,
  "plugin": { "version": "0.1.0", "apiVersionMatch": true, "fileName": "My File", "pageName": "Page 1" },
  "hints": ["All systems nominal. Draw with figma_write; verify with figma_read layout_audit."]
}
```

If `pluginConnected` is `false` or a hint mentions a version mismatch or missing heartbeat, see the troubleshooting table in [`docs/INSTALL.md`](./docs/INSTALL.md).

`pluginConnected` is tri-state: `true`/`false` are **measured**, `null` means **unknown** — a follower process could not query the leader (see `statusSource` and `statusError`). Treat `null` as "no information", not as disconnected: operations may still be forwarding fine, so do not reinstall or restart the plugin on the strength of a `null`.

</details>

> **Every session after setup:** open your Figma file → **Plugins → Development → Reqwise Figma MCP** → leave the window open. Figma doesn't auto-start plugins.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `figma_status` | Rich connection diagnostics — plugin connection, leader/follower mode, heartbeat, queue, sessions, and an ordered `hints` list. Never a bare boolean. |
| `figma_read` | Read the canvas via an `op` enum (`get_document_info`, `get_selection`, `read_selection`, `get_design_context`, `get_design_system_kit`, `generate_design_md`, `search_nodes`, `screenshot`, `layout_audit`, ...) with token-frugal responses. |
| `figma_write` | Execute modern-ES JavaScript against the `figma.*` proxy to create/modify the canvas. `state` persists per session. |
| `figma_rules` | One-call design-system rule sheet (styles + variables + components) as markdown — read before drawing so you reuse instead of hardcode. For a durable spec, use `figma_read` op `generate_design_md` and save the returned markdown as `design-kit.md`. |
| `figma_docs` | On-demand documentation: `rules` \| `layout` \| `api` \| `tokens` \| `icons` \| `recipes` \| `style`. Read `style` when there's no design system to reuse — it's the brand-neutral default scale/palette/elevation to fall back on instead of inventing values. |

Full parameter reference for every operation and every `figma.*` method: [`docs/TOOLS.md`](./docs/TOOLS.md).

## Example: `figma_write`

```js
// Set tokens once — they persist in this session's `state.tokens`.
await figma.setupTokens({
  colors: { primary: "#2563EB", surface: "#0B0B0F" },
  numbers: { "radius-md": 8 },
});

// Draw a card with wrapping text, reusing the parent's width.
const card = await figma.create({
  type: "FRAME", name: "Card", parentId: state.rootId,
  width: 320, layoutMode: "VERTICAL",
});
await figma.applyVariable(card.id, "fills", "surface");
await figma.create({
  type: "TEXT", parentId: card.id, wrap: true,
  characters: "A long paragraph that must wrap inside the card.",
});

// Verify before screenshotting for a human.
const audit = await figma.layoutAudit(card.id);
if (audit.summary.issues.length) console.warn(audit.summary.issues);
```

## Example: snapshot a design system to `design-kit.md`

Ask your agent to call:

```json
{ "op": "generate_design_md", "params": { "depth": 3, "includeAnatomy": true, "includeScreens": true } }
```

The response contains a source-grounded markdown snapshot: extraction coverage, colors,
typography, observed layout frequencies, screen composition evidence, local and
remote component usage, exact node ids/keys/variant ids/property keys, ready-to-run
instantiate examples, reuse rules, responsive evidence and known gaps. Save
it in the target codebase as **`design-kit.md`** before asking the agent to create UI
from an existing Figma component system. Facts are separated from observations and
unknown UX semantics. For a very large file, tune `maxComponents`, `maxScreens`,
`maxInstances` or `maxOutputChars`; output limits omit complete sections rather
than cutting Markdown mid-table/code-block.

> **`design.md` and `design-kit.md` are two different files** — human intent vs.
> machine snapshot, like `package.json` vs. `package-lock.json`. The tools never
> overwrite `design.md`. See the
> [two-file workflow](./docs/RECIPES.md#the-two-file-design-system-workflow).

## Architecture

```
MCP client (Claude Code / Cursor)
      │ stdio (MCP)
      ▼
 Reqwise MCP server (Node ≥ 18, TypeScript)
      │  owns HTTP+WS server on localhost:38470 (fallback +1..+9)
      │    GET  /health    → diagnostics JSON
      │    POST /rpc       → follower → leader forwarding (auth token)
      │    WS   /ws        → Figma plugin UI connection
      ▼
 Figma Desktop plugin
   ├── ui.html   (WebSocket client, heartbeat, reconnect w/ backoff)
   └── code.js   (Plugin API executor, safe-default handlers)
```

Every operation — leader-direct or follower-forwarded — passes through one `validateOperation()` choke point before it reaches the plugin. Full topology, the leader/follower protocol, and the 15 safe-default fixes are documented in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
